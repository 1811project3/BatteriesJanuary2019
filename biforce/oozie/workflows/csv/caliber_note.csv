359064.0,Closing his eyes the whole interview. Again, this is a person that is putting a ton of effort but he was warned last week. He performed better in the LMS, however I asked him questions that he had right and couldn't answer a single one (his score was mere luck). Sadly, he has to leave from the program.

359069.0,He is adding "I think" to a LOT of his answers. He is looking around to find his answers.

He was warned last week and couldn't improve to the level of our standards. Unfortunately he needs to be released from the program.,3.0,0.0,null,TRAINEE,2.0,115502.0,290099.0

363127.0,As a global parameter, I consider this was the toughest week and it will be throughout the rest of the training. Two big topics were covered, Servlet and Angular, two different huge layers of development. As a whole the batch is getting the concepts, but need more type to grasp both sides (specially Angular). On my side, I got input from QC on what the batch lacked and patched it up, but I also got input based on their individual evaluation. My Angular teaching is on the right direction, but It needs some tweaking so the associates in the future have more performance right away (they didn't get some of the foundational concepts), however, I'm not that worried about this part because they will get more exposure with Angular development in project 2, some of them are trying in project 1, and they might use it again on project 3. Angular concepts are very practical, so developing more on it will make them grasp the concepts. I will ask them some foundation questions of both sides next week on top of the new topics to make sure they are getting it better.,3.0,0.0,null,BATCH,4.0,115502.0,\N

367007.0,Difference between redirect and forward: forward is when you get requestDispatcher from request and forward the request and response to another servlet. Client doesn't know about forward. Redirect is when the servlet sends the new url to the client and the client creates a new request.Advantage of forward: preserve req/respAdvantage of redirect: can't remember advantagesWhich is faster: forward, because it doesn't need to inform the client and redirect goes back to the clientDo either allow for request caching: don't knowWhat is Hibernate: Library that allows us to wrap around JDBC.

HQL (dialect dependent copied from earlier answer), uses more programming logic when making queries, more readable for someone who doesn't know SQL.What are some disadvantages: I can't think of one.What is a front controller: Takes in all requests and can forward to the proper controllers based on uri or header info.How did you set one up: above @WebServlet, the path would be /* so that all requests go to it, inside the code you would check the uri and check where it is being sent from and send it to the correct controller using sendredirect.,2.0,1.0,Good,QC_TRAINEE,4.0,115504.0,292004.0

Provided a good explanationYou can specify requestBody/responseBody You can redirect to other methods, using other request mappings.Does the Client-side under Java objects?No, they recieve JSON objects.How do they get JSON objects?You can use requestBody to translate JSON to Java object, and responseBody to convert  back into JSON.,2.0,1.0,Good,QC_TRAINEE,6.0,115509.0,296010.0
