Current oozie workflow.

Need to go into /biforce/biforce/oozie/workflows/setup and run the oozie job on biforce-setup.xml

After that oozie job is completed, run the main workflow in biforce/biforce/oozie/workflows (this current folder) on workflow.xml

This will run the jobs we created on Sqoop utilizing the metastore and incremental imports.

Setup:
	1. Completely fill the properties files with information
	2. Create ssh password-less login for the oozie user to cloudera user
	3. Create ssh password-less login for the cloudera user to emr cluster 

How to create ssh password-less login
In general---
1. For cloudera, su and go to /etc/ssh/sshd_config and edit that file
2. Enable:
	RSAAuthentication yes
	PubkeyAuthentication yes
3. Restart ssh service (Usually a VM restart would be okay)

Oozie to cloudera---
1. Ensure that home directory has permissions 750
2. Type sudo -u oozie -s
3. Run the command ssh-keygen and just press enter for all defaults.
4. ssh-copy-id cloudera@quickstart (if it prompts for password, enter it)
5. To test passwordless ssh, type ssh cloudera@quickstart ls
6. Type exit and go back to cloudera user
 
Cloudera to EMR Cluster---
1. Type ssh-keygen to form a .pub key
2. Go to ~/.ssh
3. Transfer this id_rsa.pub key over to your EMR cluster's authorized keys. You can do this by going to ~/.ssh on the EMR cluster and appending the id_rsa.pub to the end of it.
4. Run ssh-add to add the agent.
5. You should now be able to ssh your EMR without a password.

Workflow.xml----------
	Runs Sqoop jobs to upload data into S3 Warehouse
	Runs ssh-actions below:
		Import data into hive using invokehiveimports.sh
		Export hive to CSV using hivetocsv.sh
		Transfer CSV to EMR for spark jobs using invokeEMR.sh
