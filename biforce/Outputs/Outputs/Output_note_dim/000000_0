361063,Going solid for Junaid, needs to review some small topics. Asked me questions about JavaScript being a programming language, he was told that it isn't in QC (but he didn't defend his answer). ERS First Sprint: Behind, he only has his the DB scripts defined, told him that he needs to speed up. I was expecting half or all of the repository methods done. He will give me an update on friday of his progress.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,3
361064,Everything going very good for him, solid scores as every week. ERS First Sprint: His DB is defined with everything needed (Triggers, Sequences, Constraints). Has environment variables for JDBC. Half way through the repositories. He believes he gained momentum so he will finish them fast.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,3
361065,His LMS score improved a lot, told him to try to keep it at that level. Has to review some of the topics and use the tech words with the concepts. ERS First Sprint: Tables are defined, but no functions nor triggers. No repositories implementations. Told him that he is super behind, he needs to speed it up. Will report to me on friday to show progress.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,3

All his repositories are done, he is half way through the services. He has JUnit tests for all the methods.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,3
361068,78 average is not her thing. Told her to try to go back to where she had the bar. Needs to review some topics for this week. She told me that the XML part is completely new for her and told her to be aware then because Servlets we are going to write a lot of things in XML. ERS First Sprint: Tables, Constraints, no sequences no triggers. Started JDBC, but almost nothing. Told her she is behind, gave her some guidance. She will show progress on Friday.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,3
361069,Everything going well for her, solid evaluation. Needs to work on some topics, specifically functions in JavaScript which is the most complex topic. ERS First Sprint: She is doing the database scripts in conjunction with the repositories, which is fine. She has some methods done. Gave her some input on how to reach the goal this week.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,3

363115,Highest scores in both LMS's, told him to keep it up to this. His foundation on Servlets is solid, needs more work on the concepts for the Angular side. Told him that when he gets more exposure to it in the projects the concepts will click better.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,4
363116,His LMS scores improved a lot, however, this week was though. In the one on one session didn't go that well, didn't go that bad. He will get to where the bar is but needs more time to grasp the concepts. Guided him in the right direction. I will ask him some questions of this week's topic next week.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,4
363117,Needs to be able to build up his answers in front of anyone (this was QC feedback, and it came in on the 1 on 1). Didn't go that well for him in the one on one, even though he admitted Angular concepts weren't clicking but he was able to code. Gave him some coaching on how to practice and build up his answers. Told him to balance his time between projects and studying and practicing his answer. I will ask him Angular questions and some Servlet questions next week.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,4
363118,Told me that he was frustrated about his LMS scores because he is trying to get them up but he is a bad test taker. However, told him that he is getting the concepts just fine and he is able to talk in the 1 on 1 setting very technically. Just gave him some tips on how to present exams and on how to answer questions with the right balance of information.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,4
363119,Very high scores on the LMS. He's Servlet side is solid. Needs more time to grasp the concepts on the Angular side, he is in the right direction.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,4
363120,Doing very well, was very nervous today but she knows majority of the concepts very well. Her Angular performance is great, needs some mild tweaking but she is in a very good direction with it.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,4
363121,Solid scores, caught a specific confusion that she had on a topic Servlet and patched it up (QC pointed it out). Needs to work on that and other topics but she is doing fine.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,4
363122,Following better, but needs to use the correct technical terms and show them more. Understanding is the key, not memorizing. A lot improvement compared to last week, I feel already that he's getting into the rythym of the program. If he continues to improve like this he will have no issues. Needs more time to grasp the concepts on both sides but he is on the right direction.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,4
363123,Needs some work on the advanced topics of Servlets. She is doing fine, but as everyone else needs a little bit more of time to grasp the concepts of both sides. On the soft skills side she is waving her hands to much (sometimes she uses the gestures properly).,3,false,null,TRAINEE,4
363124,Needs a lot work on the Angular side, he is getting the topics but needs more time. In the Servlet side his better. Today he was rushing on his answers even though his confidence wasn't affected and I got what he said all time. He is on the right direction, just needs more time to grasp the Angular side.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,4
363125,Needs a lot of work on the Angular side. Improvement this week nontheless, he is constructing his answers better and I have no issues understanding what he is saying. Gave me some feedback on the way I presented Angular, he had a hard time getting it that way, however, the whole class gave me good feedback about. I do have to tweak some things in the way I presented Angular so their performance increases a little bit, so I agree.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,4
363126,Talk to him about his QC feedback. Guided him a lot on what he needs to focus on. He needs to focus more on understanding the concepts fully and practicing how to construct his answers. He's charisma changes completely on the 1 on 1 or QC and his confidence goes down. On the coding side his excellent, and that's what I told him that he should grab some of the development time to focus on studying and practicing the concepts.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,4
363127,As a global parameter, I consider this was the toughest week and it will be throughout the rest of the training. Two big topics were covered, Servlet and Angular, two different huge layers of development. As a whole the batch is getting the concepts, but need more type to grasp both sides (specially Angular). On my side, I got input from QC on what the batch lacked and patched it up, but I also got input based on their individual evaluation. My Angular teaching is on the right direction, but It needs some tweaking so the associates in the future have more performance right away (they didn't get some of the foundational concepts), however, I'm not that worried about this part because they will get more exposure with Angular development in project 2, some of them are trying in project 1, and they might use it again on project 3. Angular concepts are very practical, so developing more on it will make them grasp the concepts. I will ask them some foundation questions of both sides next week on top of the new topics to make sure they are getting it better.,3,false,null,BATCH,4

378002,(verbal) 3/5 I could sense he was very very nervous but he did demonstrate knowledge. He needs to work on the presentation of said knowledge. He missed a couple terms here and there and was missing the point of some of the design patterns but he is on the right track,3,false,null,TRAINEE,3
378003,(verbal) 0/5 For twenty plus minutes he told me why he couldn't answer the question. And due to a miscommunication between Steve and I, Steve ended up covering my one on one topic while I still have 5 more interviews to go. So this is AFTER Steve literally reviewed the exact question I asked him Damon no more than an hour before his one on one interview. And even still he couldn't describe anything to me because he told me the question was formed in a way he couldn't respond to. Every other person had little problem responding to my question and drawing the diagram i requested. While there could have been some of the technical knowledge there he definitely received zero alone because of the soft skills combined with the fact that I was basically just asking him to reiterate a basic very of what Steve spent an hour describing.,3,false,null,TRAINEE,3

Needs to understand more about the modules of Spring. Needs to review bean scopes. Very few people are aware of how to integrate Spring/Hibernate, no real knowledge of Contextual Sessions. Weak on AOP; they knew the advice types, but were unsure of when to use each. Overall batch should review Spring and morale is not doing well. We provided some talk at the end. Batch needs to focus on matching the theory and practical terms.,2,true,Poor,QC_BATCH,6
