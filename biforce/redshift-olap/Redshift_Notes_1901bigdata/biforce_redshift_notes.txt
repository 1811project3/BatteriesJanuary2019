"1901-Big Data" Redshift Notes

We interacted with Redshift in two ways

1. We installed postgresql and connected to / interacted with Redshift via command line.  This is what we used to create the Redshift schema
2. For simple Redshift database viewing, we used DBeaver

Various Redshift Commands:

Connect to Redshift via postgresql:
  psql -h <endpoint> -U <username> -d <database name> -p <port number, probably 5439>
  <then enter the password when prompted>

How to copy from an S3 bucket to redshift
copy <name of table in Redshift> from 's3://<database name>/<table name>' access_key_id '<access key>' secret_access_key '<secret access key>
' REGION '<region, such as us-east-2>' DELIMITER '~' \g

How to display all tables within your database:
  SELECT DISTINCT tablename
  FROM PG_TABLE_DEF
  WHERE schemaname = 'public';

How to display schema of the specific table "caliber_batch_new":
  SELECT *
  FROM pg_table_def
  WHERE tablename = 'caliber_batch_new'
  AND schemaname = 'public';

Schema Notes:
  1. All tables that begin with "caliber_*" have the same columns as the corresponding table in Caliber RDS
      -> except for "caliber_batch_new" because we added some columns
  2. The data types chosen - mainly DECIMAL and VARCHAR(255) - are functional but probably suboptimal.  Important: "DECIMAL" data type is not floating point.  Data that was originally floating point will be truncated if left as DECIMAL.
