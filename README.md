## Description
Biforce is a project conducted by Revature to improve its business decisions via re-examination of existing metrics and investigation into new metrics that will increase value of company assets. The goal is to leverage all relevant technologies to automate the process of data analysis within the business intelligence life cycle conducted on different departments within the company. The objective is to implement efficient algorithms for data processing via tools available within the Hadoop ecosystem that will run on a physical and cloud cluster.

## Objectives

## Current State
Trainee evaluations are gathered from ![Caliber](https://github.com/revaturelabs/caliber) and transformed through the use of Sqoop commands. The transformation is automated with an Oozie workflow. The resulting output is used by traditional and machine learning algorithms written using Apache Spark, which are run inside both a physical and cloud cluster. Output from Spark is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket and then is imported by Amazon Redshift. Microsoft Power BI will then visualize the data stored in Redshift using dashboards and reports, which can distributed to various clients and stakeholders.
